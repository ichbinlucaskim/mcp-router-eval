# Documentation

## Project status (as of 2026-07-01)

- **Done:** capstone proposal (with a dated post-ground-truth revision) + build-readiness report +
  firsthand ground-truth inspection; **ADRs 0001–0013**; repo scaffold; `scripts/fetch_data.py`
  (dataset pinned to commit `b630b98`); **`contracts.py` frozen** — the 4 boundary contracts
  (RouteResult / ExecPlan / ExecResult / Attribution) with **20 tests green**.
- **Current position:** end of **T1.1** on the **T1 (contract layer)** track.
- **Next:** **T1.2** invariant checks (closure-complete / dangling-param → `InvariantReport`) →
  **T1.3** deterministic attribution rule.
- Everything else in `src/mcp_router_eval/` (loader, graph_build, routers, embedding, executor, eval)
  is still an intentional stub (`raise NotImplementedError`).

## Standing rule — verify before asserting (all sessions)

When any decision, convention, or fact is uncertain or ambiguous — data-format questions, library
behavior, best-practice architecture, an unfamiliar term, whether an approach is standard — **do not
guess and do not proceed on assumption**. **Search the web first**, verify against a credible source,
**cite** what was found, then act. Prefer verified fact over plausible-sounding memory. If a claim
cannot be verified, **say so explicitly** rather than asserting it.

## Reference docs

- [`data-inspection-toollinkos.md`](data-inspection-toollinkos.md) — firsthand ground-truth of the dataset.
- [`build-readiness-report.md`](build-readiness-report.md) — point-in-time environment/dataset inspection (with dated corrections).
- [`completion-scoring-examples.md`](completion-scoring-examples.md) — worked structural-completion scenarios (test-case ready).
- [`feasibility-completion.md`](feasibility-completion.md) — cycle/DAG analysis; PARAMETER sub-graph is acyclic.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

`adr/` holds one file per significant decision, numbered sequentially (`NNNN-title.md`).

**Convention:** every future significant decision gets a new numbered ADR **before** the code that
implements it is written. Never delete an ADR — supersede it with a new one and mark the old one's
Status accordingly (`Superseded by NNNN`).

Each ADR uses the format in [`adr/0000-adr-template.md`](adr/0000-adr-template.md):
Title / Status / Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives considered.
